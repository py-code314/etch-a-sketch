# Etch-A-Sketch
## TOP project to create a webpage similar to Etch A Sketch

## Description
Etch A Sketch is a classic drawing toy that allows users to create artwork by manipulating two knobs that control a stylus moving on a screen coated with aluminum powder.This project tries to recreate the Etch-A-Sketch effect, by creating a webpage which contains a grid of small squares, each neatly arranged in rows and columns on the left side and buttons on the right. You can use the cursor like a paintbrush to draw on the grid. As you move your cursor over any square, it smoothly fills with vibrant colors, creating a dynamic and interactive visual experience. This effect transforms the grid into a canvas that responds to your movements, offering a playful way to explore color combinations and patterns. Using this you can create your own art with ease! Happy drawing!ðŸŽ¨


## How To Use
### Grid
* When you first load the page, you will see a grid the size of 16x16 which is the default.
* To change the number of rows and columns, enter a number in the box on top of the grid and click "Submit". 
* The minimum number of rows and columns is 16 and the maximum is 100.
* Please keep in mind that when you change the number of rows and columns, your previous drawing will be cleared.
  

### Buttons
* To select a color, click the Color Picker on **Choose a Color** button.
* To get a random color, click the **Random Color** button.
* To get random colors on each interaction with the squares, click the **Rainbow** button.
* To fill the squares with a progressively darker color, click the **Chiaroscuro (Light - Dark)** button.
* To clear the color from a square, click the **Clear** button.
* To clear the entire grid with a single click, click the **Reset** button.
